As our company moved to integrate products, we needed a filtering mechanism that could be used across the platform and satisfy the needs of all products. During this project, I lead the cross-team design process of creating this new feature.</p></div>

As the project progressed, more stakeholder became interested in leveraging the design in their future products and contributed additional requirements to consider. This was an exercise in managing multiple (sometimes conflicting) sets of requirements and distilling them into a single feature that could be used and re-used by all interested parties. </p></div>
